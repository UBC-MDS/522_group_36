Analysis

Linear regression is a fundamental and widely used method for predictive modeling. For this analysis, a linear regression model was employed, incorporating a complexity hyperparameter α\alphaα, which serves as a regularization parameter to control overfitting and improve model generalizability.
All numerical variables included in the TLC Trip Record Data, with the exception of payment types, rate types, and dispatching base license numbers, were used to fit the model. The data was split into training and test sets, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for testing.
The hyperparameter α\alphaα was tuned using 30-fold cross-validation, optimizing for the mean squared error (MSE) to balance bias and variance. Numerical features were standardized before model fitting to ensure that each variable contributed equally to the model, preventing dominance by variables with larger scales.
The analysis was conducted using the Python programming language [Van Rossum and Drake, 2009], with the following Python packages: numpy [Harris et al., 2020], pandas [McKinney, 2010; VanderPlas, 2018], scikit-learn [Pedregosa et al., 2011], and altair [VanderPlas et al., 2018].
