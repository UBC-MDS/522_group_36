Data

The data set used in this project is the TLC Trip Record Data, which includes taxi and for-hire vehicle trip records collected by technology providers authorized under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). This data is sourced from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) and can be accessed here.
Yellow and green taxi trip records contain fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates and times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. Similarly, For-Hire Vehicle (FHV) trip records include fields such as dispatching base license number, pick-up date and time, and taxi zone location ID.
It is important to note that the TLC did not create this data and makes no representations regarding its accuracy. FHV trip records are based on submissions from dispatching bases and may not represent the total volume of trips. Additionally, the TLC reviews these records and enforces necessary actions to improve their accuracy and completeness.
