# NYC Yellow Taxi Fare Predictor ðŸš•


## About

In this project we attempt to predict the fare price of yellow taxi trips in NYC. First, we analyzed 30,000 NYC yellow taxi trips in January 2024. Then, we determined that we should check how well trip distance predicts the fare price. Using simple linear regression model with trip distance as the independent variable and fare price as the dependent variable, we ended up with a model that predicts that each additional mile travelled is associated with a $3.62 increase in the fare price. The model performed decently well - the R^2 value was 0.848. This means that 84.8% of the variance in the fare prices were explained by our model. If potential NYC taxi customers know how long their trip is, they can use our model to predict their taxi fare price.

## Usage

### Setup

> If you are using Windows or Mac, make sure Docker Desktop is running.

### Running the analysis

1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the root of this project**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_522_Group36_taxi_fare_predictor.git
    cd DSCI_522_Group36_taxi_fare_predictor
    ```
    
2. **Run the container using the command line**
    ``` 
    docker compose up
    ```
    \* We are doing a port mapping here. To run the docker-compose, make sure your 8888 port is free. 

    If you are testing this out locally, you can also build the Docker image locally by running the following commands: 
    ```
    docker build -t taxi-fare-predictor .

    docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 -v "$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work" taxi-fare-predictor
    ```
    Make sure current working directory is the root of this project.

3. **Copy and paste the URL into your browser**
   
   In the terminal, look for a URL that starts with 
    `http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=` 

    
4. **Run data validation**
    
    ```
    python -m scripts.run_validation
    ```
    This script will check if the data is valid and print out the result. If the data is valid, it will print out "Data validation passed successfully". If the data is invalid, it will log the error messages in logs and remove those rows. The validated data will be saved in data/processed. In this testing, we only removed 2000 rows after validation which are data that is outside of the NYC taxi data [documentation](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/tlc/downloads/pdf/data_dictionary_trip_records_yellow.pdf) range.

5. **Run the analysis**

    To run the analysis, open a terminal and run the following commands:
    ```
    python -m scripts.download_data 

    python -m scripts.run_eda run-all data/processed/yellow_tripdata_2024-01_validated.csv \
    --charts_dir charts
    ```

6. **Run the model**

   To run the model, run the following commands in the terminal:

   ```
   python scripts/modeling.py --x-train-path data/processed/X_train.csv --y-train-path data/processed/y_train.csv --x-test-path data/processed/X_test.csv --y-test-path data/processed/y_test.csv
   ```
   

7. **Restart the kernel and run all cells to see the analysis**

   under the "Kernel" menu click "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells..."

### Clean up

1. To shut down the container and clean up the resources, type `Cntrl` + `C` in the terminal where you launched the container, and then type `docker compose rm`

## Developer notes

### Developer dependencies
- `conda` (version 23.9.0 or higher)
- `conda-lock` (version 2.5.7 or higher)

### Adding a new dependency

1. Add the dependency to the `environment.yml` file on a new branch.

2. Run `conda-lock -k explicit --file environment.yml -p linux-64` to update the `conda-linux-64.lock` file.

2. Re-build the Docker image locally to ensure it builds and runs properly.

3. Push the changes to GitHub. A new Docker
   image will be built and pushed to Docker Hub automatically.
   It will be tagged with the SHA for the commit that changed the file.

4. Send a pull request to merge the changes into the `main` branch.
